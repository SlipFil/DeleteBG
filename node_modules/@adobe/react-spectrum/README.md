## Getting started

The easiest way to start building a React Spectrum application is by following our [getting started](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/getting-started.html) guide. It walks through all of the steps needed to install the components from npm, set up build tooling, and create your first application.

### Example

Here is a very basic example of using React Spectrum.

```jsx
import {Provider, defaultTheme, Button} from '@adobe/react-spectrum';

// Render it in your app!
function App() {
  return (
    <Provider theme={theme}>
      <Button
        variant="cta"
        onPress={() => alert('Hey there!')}>
        Hello React Spectrum!
      </Button>
    </Provider>
  );
}
```
